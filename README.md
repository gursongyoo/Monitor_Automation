# Monitor_Automation
This project conducts web scraping from new postings from 300+ bulletin boards in Korean government websites.
Using Selenium, it automatically controls a Chrome process to visit these bulletin boards and copies links of articles posted within one week.
As each website and bulletin board is programmed differently, the parameters for each board is recorded in a separate Excel file.
After scraping, an Excel file containing the result is generated.
